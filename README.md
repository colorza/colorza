<b>hi , so apparantly . patreon is literally making me crumble by seeing none at all ?? but basic abt me

i like so many shit mcyt ( smpe , osmp , rsmp , asmp , qsmp + hardcore )
starkid ( tgwdlm , twisted + )
rhythm games ( groove coaster , muse dash + gacha ( d4dj , pjsekai , love live ) )
epic ( the musical )
yeah musical theater counts ( wicked , beetlejuice , matilda + more )

i can be late to responding whispers for those people who crowned me just know i appreciate you and will respond late
also statuses probably good to check uh

online - im probably okay w int
looking for chat - i need some1 to int w me
looking for roleplay - probably barely but its in the name
away - i accidentally keep on not shutting this off but likely afk or online
busy - likely likely afk or saying to not int

do not use my skins for your own , my skins aren 't allowed to be copied at all .

i justify emerald duo 's friendship . not family dynamic but i will respect said users that likes fanon dynamic ( wilbur is an expection to this since he is the only son of c phil in canon )
i hate the dsmp finale dont think you misread that ( dream and tommy confrontation arc )</b>

<i>just know that this is a alternative and no i cannot make this so aesthetic , so have this despite i couldve code to add some silly shit man i am tired to code at all</i>
